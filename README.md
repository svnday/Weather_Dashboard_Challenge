# Weather_Dashboard_Challenge  
This project is an application that allows you to see the current and 5-day forecast for a city you search. The cards that dynamically generate using the OpenWeather API will give you key weather information for that area. This application will also save your previous searches so that you can return to them later.

## USER STORY  
AS A traveler  
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities  
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly  

## Acceptance Criteria  
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs  
WHEN I search for a city  
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history  
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city  
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind   speed, and the UV index  
WHEN I view the UV index  
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe  
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city  
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind   speed, and the humidity  
WHEN I click on a city in the search history  
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
